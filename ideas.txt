1. find a good way to present the phrase to the user
    -find library
2. Mess with the model options (it is starting to not do what I want it to do)
    -model seems to be simply summaring the collection of phrases and not adding anything to it
    -interestingly started to happen once I wrote phrase printing function in same file

Things I have learned:
1. F-strings
2. It is incredibly important to save your files before running scripts (lol)
3. some experience w/ "with" context manager
4. readlines()
5. len function
