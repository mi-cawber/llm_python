# llm_python

This is a fun project which uses Ollama's llama3.2 model to generate phrases that are similar to the ones that
the player is presented with when leveling up in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion.

I got the idea when playing Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remaster. Whenever you level up
in that game, you are presented with a little motivational quote, and they are pretty cool.

Here is an example: "So that's how it works. You plod along, putting one foot before the other, look up, and suddenly, there you are. Right where you wanted to be all along."

There are in total 20 of these quotations I believe before the last one simply repeats on subsequent level ups.

I thought it would be cool to use an llm to generate new quotes like this and have them presented to me when I want.
